# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

# Project Description

This project focuses on predicting loan approval outcomes based on a variety of factors such as credit history, income, loan amount, and others. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the aim is to assist financial institutions in making informed decisions, thereby streamlining the loan approval process. The predictive model developed in Python showcases high accuracy, precision, and recall, making it a reliable tool for real-time loan approval processes.

# Technologies Used

Python: For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the predictive model.
Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 10,000 loan applications with various attributes such as Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and more.

# Features Engineered

5 key features were engineered to improve the model's predictive performance, including:

* Applicant's Income to Loan Amount Ratio
* Total Income (Applicant and Coapplicant)
* Loan Amount to Term Ratio
* Credit History Status

# Model Development
A machine learning model was developed to predict loan approval with the following key metrics:

* ### Accuracy:### 85%
* ### Precision:### 90%
* ### Recall:### 80%
The model was trained, tested, and validated on the dataset, ensuring robust performance and reliability.

# Results

The predictive model demonstrated its reliability in the loan approval process with high accuracy, precision, and recall. It significantly enhances decision-making, allowing for a more efficient and streamlined loan approval process in a production environment.
